Today, finally my Donkey car is fully assembled and ready to run. The mechanical
parts are produced by 3D printer much better than I expected. The holes on the
top plate to connect to the body mounting posts are well located.
In order to assemble the hardware for Basher Bad Bug, I mainly made the following
changes.
1) The top plate was modified from the original one meant for Magnate mainly to
adapt the holes for the body mounting posts.
2) The length of the body mounts was too short. If the top plate was mounted
on the default posts, the top plate could not become level.
I purchased the longer body mounting posts designed for Basher Hell Seeker which is
a brother of Bad Bug.
