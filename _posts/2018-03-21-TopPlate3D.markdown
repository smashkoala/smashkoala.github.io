For the mechanics to be mounted on the RC car, I downloaded the original 3D design
of the top plate and roll cage. They are in a Fusion360 file.
I modified the file so that they fit to my Basher HellSeeker RC car.

The following is the modified 3D design image.

I requested to 3D print this part and the roll cage through [3DHUB].
