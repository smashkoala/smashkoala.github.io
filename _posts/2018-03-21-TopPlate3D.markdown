For the mechanics to be mounted on the RC car, I downloaded the original 3D design
of the top plate and roll cage. They are in a Fusion360 file.
I modified the file so that they fit to my Basher HellSeeker RC car.

The following is the modified 3D design image.
It required some redesign of the positions of the holes on the top plate for
the body support poles from the original Magnet RC top plate.

I requested to 3D print this part and the roll cage through [3DHUB].
This will be shipped tomorrow. Hopefully, I can start assembling the hardware soon.
