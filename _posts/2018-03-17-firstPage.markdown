Donkey is an open source self driving RC car.
With a neural network model based on Keras running on Python, it drives by itself.
It uses Raspberry PI for processing trained neural network model.

For more information about what they can do and how to build, see [Donkey]

I will build a Donkey car, and expand the capability of the car by adding
more sensors in future.

The 1st target now is to build the Donkey car hardware. For this, I need to
re-design the existing 3D design of Donkey mount, and produce it by 3D printer.
